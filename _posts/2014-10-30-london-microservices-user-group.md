The Microservices approach, technology and community are fairly new.

We sponsor and support the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/London-Microservices-User-Group/" target="_blank">London Microservices User Group</a> events and community. It runs at 6:30pm on the first Wednesday of every month, at SkillsMatters premises, currently in Goswell Road near to Barbican tube station

Meetups are planned up to 6 months in advance and follow a regular cadence in the subject matter to ensure that a good variety of all the knowledge needed to successfully build and run a Microservices based system is covered.

The schedule is :-
<ul>
	<li>API design, Versioning and migration</li>
	<li>Service Discovery</li>
	<li>Inter-Service Communication</li>
	<li>People and Business</li>
	<li>Deployment Infrastructure</li>
	<li>Monitoring</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

We move through this cycle and then start again at the beginning.

If you are interested in attending then sign up at the Meetup group for announcements and event notifications. If you'd like to present or have something you'd like to see, then <a href="/#contactus" target="_blank">Contact Us</a> and we'd be very happy to chat.
