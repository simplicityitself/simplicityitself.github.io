I had a great time at the Spring eXchange this year, once again! (but this time managed to only attend the second day, which meant I missed out on the after-show party from Day 1 ... possibly a good thing, but I'll aim to be making it next year!).

Highlights for me from the day were Josh's <a title="" href="https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/5393-bootiful-microservices-with-spring-cloud">fast-jet tour of Spring Cloud</a>,<a title="" href="https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/5388-innovate-compete-or-die">giving my own keynote</a> (obviously!), and in particular I was really honoured to have the excellentÂ <a href="http://www.snowflakesoftware.com/" target="_blank">Snowflake Software</a> talk about the benefits they've seen in their own usage of my Life Preserver pattern and tool in relation to their Spring product development.

<a title="" href="https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/5942-getting-objective-about-improving-architecture-with-spring-and-the-life-preserver">Snowflake's very own Eddie Curtis' talk</a> is well worth watching if you're beginning to experiment with my Life Preserver tool and want a tour of a real-world solution as well as a list of the specific benefits that Snowflake are using the tool to get. The following gallery of photos shows the main flow of Eddie's talk
