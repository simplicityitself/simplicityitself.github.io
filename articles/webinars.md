<h3><span style="color: #800000;">This event has now passed</span></h3>
In his book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Antifragile-Things-That-Disorder-Incerto/dp/1400067820" target="_blank">“Antifragile: Things That Gain from Disorder,”</a>, <a href="http://www.fooledbyrandomness.com" target="_blank">Nassim Nicholas Taleb</a> introduced the concept of <em>antifragility</em>.

First, Taleb distinguishes between the fragile, robust, and antifragile: “the fragile wants tranquility, the antifragile grows from disorder, and the robust doesn’t care too much.”

Next, Taleb advances that “by grasping the mechanisms of antifragility we can build a systematic and broad guide to non-predictive decision making under uncertainty in business, politics, medicine, and life in general.”

As the world continues to become increasingly interconnected and interdependent, Black Swans — large-scale unpredictable and irregular events of massive consequence — are necessarily becoming more prominent!

As a result of the proliferation of volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity, non-predictive decision making is quintessential — and individuals, teams &amp; groups, and organizations &amp; enterprises are embracing the quest for greater antifragility to realize greater <strong>employee engagement</strong> and <strong>market innovation &amp; disruption</strong>!

Join <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/russmiles" target="_blank">Russ Miles</a> and <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/salhir" target="_blank">Si Alhir</a> as they host a panel of practitioners to explore:
<ul>
	<li>How these practitioners have interpreted Taleb’s concept of Antifragility,</li>
	<li>How these practitioners have translated their interpretation into practice, and</li>
	<li>The results and impacts of their efforts --- <strong><em>Practice Beyond the Rhetoric!</em></strong></li>
</ul>
If you’ve embraced any degree of agility, don’t miss this opportunity to go beyond agility and explore antifragility in practice...

<em><strong>While agility involves responding to change, antifragility involves gaining from disorder; and while agility emphasizes embracing change through inspecting and adapting, antifragility emphasizes embracing chaos through adapting and evolving!
