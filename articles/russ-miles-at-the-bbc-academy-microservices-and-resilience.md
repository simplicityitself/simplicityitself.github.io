Late last year, Russ Miles gave a talk at the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/academy/technology/article/art20141001095726612" target="_blank">{ develop: BBC }</a> conference entitled <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/academy/technology/article/art20141001095726612#antifragile" target="_blank">Introducing Antifragile Software</a>. This conference is hosted by the BBC Academy, a great example of an organisation investing in itself and it's staff.

The BBC Academy have since released two videos made up of interviews and footage from around the event that are well worth a watch featuring Russ, James Lewis from Thoughtworks, Rachel Evans from BBC and Jamie Allen from Typesafe.
<h3>Monoliths and Microservices</h3>
Microservices are a new way of building software, building on the lessons of Service Oriented Architecture and other distributed technologies and architectural approaches. It gives the option of using new language, platform and runtime characteristics as required. Employed properly, it can give you a way to sustain innovation beyond what is possible in a single <em>monolithic</em> architecture.

<em>“These are systems that want stresses. They get better with stress”</em> - Russ Miles

<h3>The Need for Resilience</h3>
Technology failures have been in evidence over the last year, from IaaS data centre failures, streaming video service outages or Government systems being overloaded, it is clear that the perfect world imagined when a system is conceived is a fairy tale.  The systems we build must be able to adapt to a changing environment and deal with failure, whether it is external or internal, in a graceful way rather than breaking.

The <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/academy/technology/article/art20150112142913467" target="_blank">BBC Academy video</a> extols the virtue of <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/academy/technology/article/art20150112142913467" target="_blank"><em>Resilience</em></a>

Antifragility, a term coined by Nassim Taleb, describes a system that goes beyond resilient. It does not ignore change, as a robust or fragile system does or simply adapt to change, as a resilient system will. Instead, an antifragile system will gain strength from the changing environment, and improve itself in response to stress.

Sound interesting?  We are running a webinar on the subject of <a title="Antifragility Webinars: Practice Beyond the Rhetoric!" href="/antifragile/webinars/" target="_blank">Antifragility in software</a> in early March with thought leaders on the subject.
