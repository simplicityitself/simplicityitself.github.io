For many, the concept of containerised deployment, as now epitomised by Docker, has become synonymous with Microservice development. There is much more to consider than the deployment environment when building microservices, however this is a very important topic and one that is very easy to become overly entangled with.  This article gives a brief overview of the various high level options.

Not all deployment platforms and technologies are equal, and the various methods that you use to deploy have significant trade offs.

This article is structured around the high level functionality provided by the various platforms, and the technologies that currently fit into those systems.

This list is far from complete in terms of products.  Through necessity, we take certain exemplars of the various classes systems as stand ins for the group as a whole.

Broadly, we categorise deployment platforms into: Infrastructure as a Service, Platform as a Service, Container as a Service, Stack your own Docker.

We choose to build Microservice based systems for the properties that they deliver. Primarily, for us, this is the ability to handle change pressures on the system in more effective ways.  Being able to vary deployment platforms and adopt new ones as time goes on is important for us and so becoming tied to a new platform seems just as wrong as being tied to the old platform we see our clients attempting to escape from, so Avoiding Deployment Lock In is important enough a subject to be discussed by itself.
