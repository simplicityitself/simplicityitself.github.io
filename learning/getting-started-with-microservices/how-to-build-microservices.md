Microservices are undergoing the inevitable hype cycle given to every new architecture and popular technology.

This series of articles is written to demistify the approach, show you how to go about building Microservices and give you enough information so that you know what questions to ask next.

We cover the principles, how to design Microservices and the various technologies and techniques you will need in order to successfully build them.
<h3>Microservices in a nutshell</h3>
From a conceptual point of view, Microservices are not really new. It is taking the ideas that were good in Object Oriented programming, Service Oriented Architecture and Domain Driven Design and giving them a different technological foundation.<img class=" size-thumbnail wp-image-1303 aligncenter" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/nutshell-150x150.jpg" alt="nutshell" width="150" height="150" /> That new foundation delivers new options for structuring your systems, and allows you to meet new challenges in innovative ways.

Our approach, whether using Microservices or not is to model change pressures on a system. We find that Microservices delivers a very effective set of tools for meeting the constantly changing environment we and our clients find themselves in.

We seek to build systems that not only meet that change, but thrive off the back of it, moving into the territory of <a title="Antifragility Webinars: Practice Beyond the Rhetoric!" href="/antifragile/webinars/"><em>Antifragile Software</em></a>

The Microservices approach is not a panacea, there are some very real costs to applying it. As you read through these articles, those costs will be highlighted, along with our recommended approach for applying the various techniques and technologies.
<h3>Process for Adoption</h3>
We recommend a 3 stage process for adopting a Microservices approach on a new project

<strong><em>Stage 1</em></strong> - <em>Understand change and how it affects your systems</em>.  Your primary motivation for coming to Microservices is because you see your current way of development doesn't seem to be working. You need to know why that is the case before you can make a rational decision on what to do about it.

<em><strong>Stage 2</strong></em> - <em>Prepare the Ground</em>. Here, you will get your technical infrastructure ready for a Microservices approach, and begin to evaluate the costs of implementing it.

<em><strong>Stage 3</strong></em> - <em>Sustainably Develop</em>. This starts by building a monolith. A monolithic system is the right answer for sections of your application that are evolving at the same rate. During primary development, this is generally the case. Once you begin to see the change pressures developing in different ways in your application, you can meet them by applying the Microservice approach.

This article series currently covers phases 2 and 3 of this process.
