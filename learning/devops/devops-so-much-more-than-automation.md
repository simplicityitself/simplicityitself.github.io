<em>Speed, innovation, competitive advantage...</em>

DevOps promises a lot, but many of us remember Agile processes promising much the same. It’s easy to confuse DevOps with automation, but here at Simplicity Itself we’ve a reputation for taking the best parts of processes and practices and applying them effectively within the unique context of our client-base’s organisations and we’ve found there is so much more to DevOps than just automation.

And, in some respects, less...
<h3>The Key is "You write it; you run it"</h3>
This is what we’ve found to be the real key to successful DevOps. When your individual and teams take responsibility, and are given the tools and practices, to really own their code in production, multiple important side-benefits, such as exposing great metrics and ensuring knowledge dissemination, really come into play all on their own. After all, when you own the code you wrote in production you’d like to be able to go on holiday, and you can only do that if others know what you’ve created as well as you do.

But getting here is a real challenge for most organisations, and individuals! There are so many things to be tried, and those things can overlap in systemic ways that mean their adoption in isolation may mean no benefit at all… Just take a look at the following list for some of the different practices that Simplicity Itself advise on when considering adopting a DevOps approach, organised into four areas of consideration:
<ul>
	<li>“<strong>Discover</strong>”: Techniques for gradually evolving your understanding of the solution and guiding the resulting work. “Building the right thing”.</li>
	<li>“<strong>Write</strong>”: Techniques for creating the system itself. “Building the right thing, right”.</li>
	<li>“<strong>Run</strong>”: Techniques for running the system. “Run it yourself”.</li>
	<li>“<strong>People</strong>”: Techniques for helping people adjust to their new roles and contributions. “Own it”.</li>
</ul>
The following are just a small sample of techniques from each of these areas.

A sample from “<strong>Discover</strong>”:
<ul>
	<li>Impact Mapping</li>
	<li>BDD</li>
	<li>Real Options</li>
	<li>User Story Mapping</li>
	<li>Specification by Example</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

A sample from “<strong>Write</strong>”:
<ul>
	<li>Life Preserver Approach and Tool</li>
	<li>DDD</li>
	<li>TDD &amp; BDD</li>
	<li>Data Flows</li>
	<li>Event Sourcing</li>
	<li>Stressors</li>
	<li>Reactive Microservices</li>
	<li>Continuous Delivery</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

A sample from “<strong>Run</strong>”:
<ul>
	<li>More Stressors</li>
	<li>Actionable Metrics</li>
	<li>Blue/Green</li>
	<li>Compensation Strategies</li>
	<li>Cloud</li>
	<li>Service Marketplace</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

A sample from “<strong>People</strong>”:
<ul>
	<li>Work visibility &amp; Information Radiators</li>
	<li>Simplicity</li>
	<li>Financial Accountability</li>
	<li>Inverse Conways Law</li>
	<li>Tribes</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

This is why many DevOps adoptions stop at simple automation without embracing the bigger challenge, and why they don’t always get the benefits they’ve been looking for.

Taking in the full gamut of potential things you could do, It’s hard to figure out what steps you should take first or, if you have already begun your DevOps journey, what the next step should be...
<h3>Process Change through Experiments: Introducing the Simplicity Approach to DevOps Adoption</h3>
Your environment is unique and the options for getting real, tangible and measurable benefits out of DevOps adoption through process and practice change can mean the difference between being a winner or a loser in your own competitive industry.

This means the impact you’ll gain is going to be unique for whatever you adopt. For example, automation of your continuous delivery pipeline may gain you a lot in terms of predictable releases, but if you’re releasing the wrong thing this won’t help at all.

We think there’s a better way; following the <em>Cynefin</em> approach to the complex domain of software development, we <em>probe</em> to learn more before we advise our clients to adopt a new practice. We call these probes <em>Experiments</em>, and they are all part of our <a href="http://qconlondon.com/london-2012/qconlondon.com/london-2012/presentations/show_presentation20c4.html?oid=3894" target="_blank"><em>Experimental Approach to Process Change</em></a>
<h3>An Example: Will I get benefit from Impact Mapping?</h3>
Should you adopt Impact Mapping as a technique? It’s a relatively new tool for building roadmaps for your software development products, providing a visual and fast way to expose assumptions and to experiment with the route to a valuable destination rather than having to settle on one route up front.

But will you get benefit from this? Maybe, maybe not. We don’t know, but we do have a way to find out.

In this case we would set up a small experiment. The hypothesis would be something along the lines of “I expect Impact Mapping to help me

It’s difficult in the complex domain to come up with meaningful measurements to prove or disprove our hypothesis, but that shouldn’t stop us attempting to find some! In this example, something along the lines of measuring the number of options explored and assumptions that were highlighted that the individuals involved may have disregarded, if they’re being honest, much suffice to prove that Impact Mapping should indeed bring some tangible value.

Then a gradual and careful roll-out could be performed, looking at the resulting measurements as we go to see that real benefit is indeed being found in other areas, always bearing in mind that what may work for one part of a single organisation just may not work somewhere else.

One size never fits all, and so this approach embraces that fact.

If Impact Mapping appears to have no tangible benefit, then it can be dropped like the proverbial rock for that specific area. It then may be worthwhile probing elsewhere with this experiment, or maybe trying a different experiment altogether.

It’s hardly conclusive, but it’s a better indicator than nothing and great considering we’re working in the complex domain of software development and delivery.
<h3>Themes for Change</h3>
When assessing which areas of a software delivery system to change we use the big questions of software development to guide us, namely:
<ul>
	<li>“Building the right thing” - how to discover and plan to build what’s wanted, as that changes.</li>
	<li>“Building the right thing, right” - how to build systems that can adapt and even thrive on change</li>
	<li>“You write it; you own it” - how to manage your systems into production and beyond</li>
	<li>“At the heart, it’s about People” - how to organise and structure your people to best effect</li>
</ul>
It is from these four areas that we draw experiments based on the impacts our clients want to see.
<h3>Tying it all together with Systems Thinking</h3>
If each experiment were attempted in complete isolation then we’d be missing a real trick, and potentially missing damaging effects elsewhere in the complex domain that were entirely unpredictable but related in some sense to our experimentation.

Luckily there is a relatively proven technique for watching out for those secondary, tertiary and sometimes completely disconnected effects: Systems Thinking.

While conducting our experiments with our clients on changing their delivery process we carefully observe the whole system as much as possible using Systems Thinking to detect what other, beneficial and sometimes not so beneficial, impacts may be occurring.
<h3>In Summary</h3>
Approaching any change to the complex system of software development and delivery is going to be a minefield given the uniqueness of each context. The organisation will be different, the politics will be different, the <em>people</em> will be different.

In all those settings, adopting DevOps to effectively get its benefits can be a real challenge.

The Simplicity Itself Devops Adoption Approach builds on our Experiment Driven Process Change in order to provide a tailored way for organisations to apply the many different facets to DevOps adoption to their environment to the get the specific benefits and impacts that they want.

In further articles in this series we will explore real experiments we’ve run to introduce the process, practices and techniques to get the benefits of DevOps.

In the Simplicity Itself “Knowledge” we’ll be journeys that we take our clients on to gain the benefits of DevOps within their unique contexts, going far beyond the constraints of automation to help people and teams take on the responsibility and the promise of “You write it; you run it”.
