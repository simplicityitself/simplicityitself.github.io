We invest heavily into research, with each of our consultants (including the management team), spending at least a quarter of our time on research and development activities.

This supports our ability to create new an innovative products and solutions, run experiments on new approaches and keep abreast of technical advancements across a broad swathe of technology and development practice.

The results of this investment, we present as <em>The Knowledge</em>.

This can be consumed in two forms, firstly we publish a regular email notification of free content we add to SimplicityItself.com.  This includes new articles on system architecture, advances in learning and upcoming events. Subscribing will give you advance access to our articles and a discount on our training, consultancy and other products if you decide to take advantage of them.
<h3>Free Advance Content Updates</h3>
