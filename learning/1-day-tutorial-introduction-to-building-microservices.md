This hands-on, extremely practical 1 day tutorial will teach you how to design, deploy and manage microservice based architectures

Microservices are a new approach to architecting applications that embrace and thrive on change. They are simple, single-purpose, lightweight architectural components that enable you to deliver software faster.

The microservice architectural approach also aims to lead to software that thrives on change while at the same time being secure, performant, and stable.
