Want to learn Microservices?   Want a course that **is truly deep enough for you**


Want to do **more than get started**?  Want to learn cost effectively?

Other courses skim the surface of Microservices. This course, designed by the leaders of the London
Microservices User Group and industry thought leaders, goes **far deeper**.  

We use the industry leading **Adaptive Learning** method to run a 6 week course with highly interactive exercises, peer and tutor reviews,
group coding and more.

### **This course is for you**

Microservices have become the go to architecture for building modern systems for the cloud.

While they are popular, adopting them is often seen as hard, especially if you have an existing legacy system that is scary and expensive to change.

You will be guided on an introduction to Microservices, how to adopt them, and how to successfully deliver and run them in production. This covers the low level deployment and design concerns, through building an effective data architecture to putting in place an appropriate delivery pipeline, secure runtime and how to effectively monitor in production.

<strong>Duration: 6 weeks</strong>

This course covers :-

* How to get started with Microservices
* Designing microservices
* How to decompose an existing system. “Breaking the Monolith”. We give you a structured method to decide **how, why and when.**
* Handling data in a distributed system. *Tackling CAP Theorem*
* APIs, Schemas and Interaction Protocols
* Upgrading Services
* Handling service **failure**
* Building **Antifragility** into the system. A microservice deployment that improves over time
* The use of **Docker** and **Kubernetes**, in development, testing and production deployment.
* Monitoring and Management
* Testing techniques and technologies
* Continuous Delivery and **building quality pipelines**

You will **build** all of these things, not merely be taught about them.

## Format

This course is delivered using the highly effective Adaptos learning method.  
This **spreads learning over time**, allowing you time to think deeply on what you are 
doing and absorb and **retain what you learn**.

This course will run for 6 weeks, requiring around 10 hours/ week of your time. 
This covers webinars, practical work and tutorial sessions.

This course will run using a combination of :-

* Live online sessions
* One-on-one tuition, with each student guaranteed time with Microservices experts.
* Chat, individual and group, using a dedicated Slack.
* Group design, generally oriented around Google Docs
* Online sessions, using video conferencing
* Practical coding, stored and reviewed using Github and deployed using Docker and Kubernetes

The webinars and chat history will be available for the duration of the course run, and 
for **1 month after completion**.

The course is delivered as a series of *Learning Units*, covering a particular topic. Each is made up of a session introducing the topic, a set of learning materials to work through and some problems to solve. Most are group based, although they can be completed solo too if wanted.

Tutors are available on slack and by arrangement, video conference, 
to chat through ideas, discuss what you are doing and generally help you to explore 
the concepts deeply. Since each unit is able to be completed over days, rather than 
30 mins as you would get on an intensive course, this gives you time to really get to 
grips with the topics. At the end of the unit, 
an expert tutor will work through the topic with you in a review, especially on the practical sessions.


## Course Structure

### Webinars
An interactive talk introducing a topic. Questions can be asked at the end of the session. Some may be deferred to be answered offline.

Recording will generally be available for up to a month after the end of the course.

### Group Design
In the groups you work within, you will collaborate to design different aspects of your system. This will generally be done on Google Docs. Tutors will interact with you via comments on the documents and via your group slack channel.

### Coding Session
The real meat of the course!

Here, you will work both in groups and individually to complete tasks. Most will be submitted for review via pull requests (PRs). Tutors will offer feedback on each PR.

## Adopting Microservices - Learning Units
Each learning unit is a self contained module taking place over 1-3 days.  Each is started with a webinar.
